The objective of this project was to create a robot that could be placed anywhere in a room
and be able to travel to a light source. This required us to attach a light sensor that 
can rotate and scan for light periodically. We had to test multiple angles multiple times
in order to calibrate the sensor before we could use it. We then coded our solution which 
involved using the light sensor values and checking if they meet a certain threshold which
would determine how our robot would move in order to reach the light source.
